    <h1>Possible Causes </h1>
    <p>Researchers havenâ€™t yet pinpointed exactly what causes dyslexia. But they do know that genes and brain
        differences play a role. Here are some of the possible causes of dyslexia:</p>

            <h2>Genes and heredity:</h2>

            <p>Dyslexia often runs in families. About 40 percent of siblings of people with dyslexia also struggle with
                reading. As many as 49 percent of parents of kids with dyslexia have it, too. Scientists have also found
                genes linked to problems with reading and processing language.</p>

            <p>Brain imaging studies have shown brain differences between people with and without dyslexia. These
                differences happen in areas of the brain involved with key reading skills. Those skills are knowing how
                sounds are represented in words, and recognizing what written words
                look like.</p>

        <p>But the brain can change. Studies show that brain activity in people with dyslexia changes after they get
            proper instruction or tutoring. And scientists are learning more all the time.</p>
