    <h1>What is Dyslexia?</h1>
    <p>Dyslexia is a common condition that makes it hard to read.
        Some experts believe that between 5 and 10 percent of people have it. 
        Others say as many as 17 percent of people show signs of reading challenges. <br> <br> </p>
        <br><h3>Kids with dyslexia donâ€™t outgrow it.</h3> <br> <br>
        <p>But there are teaching approaches and strategies that can help people with dyslexia improve their reading skills and manage the challenges. People of any age can be tested for dyslexia, although the tests are different for adults than for kids.<br> <br>
        People with dyslexia typically have trouble reading fluently. They often read slowly and make mistakes. That can impact how well they comprehend what they read. But when other people read to them, they often have no problem understanding the text.</p>
