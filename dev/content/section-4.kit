    <h1>Getting A Diagnoses</h1>
    <p> The only way to know for sure if someone has dyslexia is through a full evaluation, done either
    at school or privately.
    Having a diagnosis (schools call it an identification) can lead to supports and services at school, and
    accommodations at college and work.
    There are a few types of professionals who can assess people for dyslexia. These include school psychologists,
    clinical psychologists, and neuropsychologists. An evaluator will give a series of tests for dyslexia. Theyâ€™ll test
    in other areas as well to see exactly where any weaknesses and strengths lie.
    School evaluations are free. But private ones can be very expensive. In some cases, there are ways to get them for
    free or at a low cost. Local universities often have programs in psychology that have clinics where students do
    their training. Teaching hospitals may have research projects where people can get evaluations for free. Learning Disabilities
    Association of America (LDA) has local chapters in every state. They may be able to help with finding free or
    low-cost options. </p>
