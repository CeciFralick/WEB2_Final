        <h1>Getting A Diagnoses</h1>
        <p> The only way to know for sure if someone has dyslexia is through a full evaluation, done either
            at school or privately.
            <br><br>
            Having a diagnosis (schools call it an identification) can lead to supports and services at school, and
            accommodations at college and work.
            <br><br>
            There are a few types of professionals who can assess people for dyslexia. These include school
            psychologists,
            clinical psychologists, and neuropsychologists. An evaluator will give a series of tests for dyslexia.
            Theyâ€™ll test
            in other areas as well to see exactly where any weaknesses and strengths lie.
            <br><br>
            School evaluations are free. But private ones can be very expensive. In some cases, there are ways to get
            them for
            free or at a low cost. Local universities often have programs in psychology that have clinics where students
            do
            their training.
            <br><br>
            Teaching hospitals may have research projects where people can get evaluations for free.
