            Meet high school senior Natalia Ditchendorf, the 2016 winner of the National Center for
            Learning Disabilities’ Anne Ford Scholarship. After high school, she’ll be studying nanorobotics
            at the University of Cincinnati. Watch this inspiring video, as Natalia and her parents discuss her love of
            math and science—and a teacher who changed everything.</p>
